Stage It is a Full-Stack application where users can book and manage appointments with home-stagers and the stagers can view all of their appointments at one place.

While creating a gallery, users can select from different layouts. They can add photos to the gallery. When the user will share this gallery with others, they will view the photos from the gallery in the selected layout.

The application enable users to:

- Add a new appointment

- Edit or remove an existing appointment

- View all of their appointments

- Search stagers who serve specific locations

- View the stager's work from their previous jobs
